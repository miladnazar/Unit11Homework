# Unit 11â€”Risky Business

![Credit Risk](Images/risky.jpg)

## Background

In this Homework I'm building and evaluating several machine-learning models to predict credit risk for the applicants who have submitted their applications to LendingClubs. Even though the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans, so I'll need employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. I'll be using imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

1. Resampling Technique 
2. Ensemble Learning Technique

### Conlusions

## Ensemble Learning Technique
*Easy Ensemble Classifier has the best balanced acuracy score of 0.931601605553446 than Ensemble Learner*
*Again Easy Ensemble Classifier has the best recall score with average of 0.94 than Ensemble Learner*
*Once Again Easy Ensemble Classifier has the best geometric mean score of 0.93 than Ensemble Learner*
*The Top 3 Feautures are F1, Recal, and Precission*

## Resampling Technique
*I only got to see the Undersampling Model balanced accuracy score which is 0.8143740911743185*
*I only got to see the Undersampling Model balanced accuracy score which is 0.80*
*I only got to see the Undersampling Model balanced accuracy score which is 0.81*
